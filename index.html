            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is an awesome system that allows you to record changes to a file or even set of files over time so that you can recall the ones you want. VCS is ideal for graphic or web designers in reverting selected files or packages back to their previous state. For example, this is a great way for those people to keep every version of an image or layout they have implemented. Also the version control system is vital for designers in recovering lost or screwed up files so that they never have to worry about losing something critical for their project.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The basic functionality of git is to record any changes at any point in the project and save it to your own repository. Each file in the directory is labeled as tracked or untracked. Tracked files mean that they are files that can be modified, unmodified, or staged and are files that Git knows about. Untracked files mean that your working directory is not in your last snapshot and not in the staging area. So as you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed thme since your last commit. After you selectively stage those modified files and then commit all those staged change, and the cycle repeats.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory. This approach is very common because it is so easy and simple, but it is also extremely error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to. However there is another method that offers more advantages for designers. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed and fixed a lot of issues. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client. The distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) is where clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. This way designers can rely on every clone has a full backup of all the data. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Recording changes in a repository is one of the most crutial parts to web application and development. Designers and creaters both have the ability to change whatever they are making and keep records of all previous data. Typically, they’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into their repository each time the project reaches a state they want to record. Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.</p>

            <p class="lead">GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for loads of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.</p>
